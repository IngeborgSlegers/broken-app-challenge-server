Welcome to this node, express, and postgreSQL challenge!

This database allows zoo keepers to create accounts (where they specify which group of animals they feed) and keep a log of animals, the time and date they were fed, and any additional notes they may have.

But someone broke this project! It is up to you to discover the 50-ish different errors (types, missing files, missing code, broken endpoints, etc) so that the animals' feeding schedules can be kept track of.

Click the green button and copy this repo's git url. In your terminal, navigate to your Blue Badge folder, type 'git clone ' and paste the git url. 

Happy sleuthing!
